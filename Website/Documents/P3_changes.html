        <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
	
        <ul>
	    <li>We are using a main "images" folder for all images, and categorizing within
	    that folder (see structure below).</li>
	    
	    <li>After speaking to our client, we decided not to have an archive. This is
	    because the Events section of the website will be focused on the main upcoming
	    events (photo and short description) and information about monthly/ongoing events.
	    For more details, the website will direct people to Facebook for upcoming events
	    and the EMW blog for more details and past events. Therefore, we do not need
	    archive.shtml or event_info.shtml.</li>

	    <li>Information about the EMW Summer Fellows program at EMW has not been released
	    yet, and there are no current summer fellows. Therefore, the pages have temporary
	    content and no images.</li>
	    
	    <li>We added an events.part file so that upcoming events can be updated easily on
	    a monthly basis.</li>
	</ul>
        
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
	    <li>We used the jQuery animate effect to switch images on hover in the Community
	    section, and to change the opacity in the Events and Organization section. </li>
	    <li>We also used a JavaScript onmouseout Event on a fixed triangle on the bottom
	    right corner to switch to a larger fixed triangle that takes the user to the top
	    (Home page) when clicked. </li>
	    <li>Date objects were not used as users adding events directly to the site was not a
	    feature that the client needed.</li>
	
	</ul>
        
        <h2>Page Layout & Appearance</h2>
        <p>Social media links (instead of icons) are now on the bottom footer bar. We decided only
	to add Youtube, and not include twitter, Flickr, Tumblr, or Instagram links since they either
	are not active or have not been created yet.</p>
	<p>Instead of using icons, we used text in the navigation bar since we wanted
	the EMW logo to stand out.</p>
	<p>Our website follows a smooth "infinite scrolling" theme, and is now a fixed layout.</p> 
	<p>Instead of the font Avenir, we used the Google Webfonts. We used "Oswald" as display text
	for h1, h2, and h3 and "Source Sans Pro" at 12px for main text. The accent colors were changed
	to match the logo colors blue (#00BFFF) and pink (#FF1D7F). <br></p>
	
	<p>The files are now organized as follows:</p>
	<h4>Organizational Structure:</h4>
	<pre>
		index.shtml
		style.css
		events.part 
		/images
		    /members
			(1 colored and 1 black & white headshot per person)
		    /orgs
			(1 logo and 1 photo per organization)
		    /icons
			(for basic buttons and icons)
		    /slideshow
			(all images for homepage slideshow)
		    emwlogo.png
		/js
		    (location for all javascript files)
		/Documents
		    P3_changes.html
		    readMe.txt
	</pre>
	
	<h2>Tasks</h2>
	<p> In an effort to be flexible and promote creativity in the design of the website, we decided
	to go with a single page website. Today, having webpages with more content is not as much of a
	problem as in the past and therefore provides designers with the opportunity to display connected
	information and sections of the website in a more logical way.</p>
	<p>To split up the task of creating one index.html page, we treated each page fragment as if it were its
	own separate page.  The main sections are still the same as our initial design proposal except for the archive
	page and event_info page.  In replacement of these two sections we now have a section on the location of EMW as well
	as 6 additional modals/page segments that are descriptions of the individual organizations that make up EMW.</p>

	<h2>Modulation and Artwork</h2>
	<p>
	    Modulation was tackled with both javascript functions and SSI.  Javascript functions were
	    used to write repeating jQuery code for repetitious parts of the html.  For example, using a
	    javascript method to apply the hover method to work on all nine icons of the community members.
	    This was done by Stephanie.  <br> Stephanie also used SSI for the upcoming events section of the
	    website, mostly to make it easier for future maintainers of the website since this will be the
	    most regularly and frequently updated. 
	</p>
	<p>
	    Artwork creation was directed by Annie.  She handled digital mockups and design direction.  All
	    banners, icons, images, and buttons were made by both Steph and Annie.
