        <p>EMW is an artist community that organizes events at a bookstore called 
        East Meets West located in Cambridge, MA. </p>
        <p> <strong>MISSION STATEMENT:</strong> EMW's mission is to establish a 
        transformative community-space to expand and fulfill creative potential.
        EMW's mission is to establish a transformative space for individuals and 
        communities to fulfill their artistic and creative potentials, overcoming 
        mental, socioeconomic, racial, and other barriers along the way.  EMW 
        Bookstore will provide space for the organic collaboration and remixing of
        science, technology, culture, music, and other art forms, allowing new modes
        of thinking and interaction to emerge.  All of our activities will be 
        rooted in a commitment to sharing, giving, trust, and mutual support and 
        respect to expand the concept of family to our immediate community and the
        world.</p>
        
        <h3>Website Goal and Purpose</h3>
        <p>As the bookstore space is being renovated, <strong>EMW would like the 
        website to inform the Boston community about new spaces, ideas, partnerships,
        and events.</strong>
        
        The <strong>goal</strong> of the website is to have a complete rebranding 
        of EMW as a non-profit arts, technology, and community space.
        
        This will be accomplished by having the website serve as a portal
        into other communities involved with EMW. </p>

        <h3>Intended User/Audience</h3>
        
        <p>This website will serve the community, both members and non-members.</p>
        <p><strong>User Type 1:</strong> As a member of the EMW community, this 
        website serves as a portal to keep him/her plugged in with the current and upcoming

        links, and to stay connected with the other members of the community.
	This website will bring all EMW-related 
        sites/blogs/components into one place, creating a visual community space 
        online. </p>
        
        <p><strong>User Type 2:</strong> As a non-member of the EMW community, 
        this website enlightens the curious user to "What is EMW?". It is important

        will be laid out so that any outside member can find out the when and what 
        events that they might attend. The user should leave with both a sense of 
        what drives EMW as an organization and what brings them together as a community.
