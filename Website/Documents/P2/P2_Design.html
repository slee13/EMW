        <h2>Administrative Details</h2>
        <p>Our client is EMW, an artist community that organizes events at a bookstore called 
        East Meets West located in Cambridge, MA. We are working most directly with Dave
        Kong, Director and Abel Cano, Associate Director of EMW.</p>
        
        <h2>Location and Maintenance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Server: Wordpress.org</li>
            <li> Future maintenance of site: Members of the EMW Community</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Purpose and Goals</h2>
        <p>As the bookstore space is being renovated, <strong>EMW would like the 
        website to inform the Boston community about new spaces, ideas, partnerships,
        and events.</strong>
        
        The <strong>goal</strong> of the website is to have a complete rebranding 
        of EMW as a non-profit arts, technology, and community space.
        
        This will be  will be accomplished by having the website serve as a portal
        into other communities involved with EMW. </p>
		
		<h3>Intended User/Audience</h3>
        
        <p>This website will serve the community, both members and non-members.</p>
        <p><strong>User Type 1:</strong> As a member of the EMW community, this 
        website serves as a portal to keep him/her plugged in with the current and upcoming
        events and projects. This website will bring all EMW-related 
        sites/blogs/components into one place, creating a visual community space 
        online. </p>
        
        <p><strong>User Type 2:</strong> As a non-member of the EMW community, 
        this website enlightens the curious user to "What is EMW?". It is important
        that the user leaves the website understanding what the mission of EMW is 
        and what it aims to accomplish.  The events, programs, and connected organizations
        will be laid out so that any outside member can find out the when and what 
        events that they might attend. The user should leave with both a sense of 
        what drives EMW as an organization and what brings them together as a community. 
        The user should have the necessary information to get plugged into EMW by 
        either attending upcoming events and/or reaching out to established members
        by signing up for the mailing list .
        </div>


		<h3>Design Goals</h3>
		<p> The purpose of this website is represent the message and vibe of EMW 
		as a community space for collaboration and innovation. Thus, the design of 
		the EMW website should have a similar vibe: approachable and simple, yet 
		creative, interactive, and innovative.  In order to achieve this, the 
		design layout will be minimalistic, user-friendly, and easily navigable. 
		The color scheme will be colorful and eye-catching, similar to the EMW 
		logo. Since upcoming events are a main focus, event flyers and images will 
		be a focal point and background colors will be white or neutral. We will 
		be using appropriate colors for easy readability and brighter colors for 
		accents. 
		</p>

		<h2> Plan: Tasks & Deadlines </h2>

		<p> 
		The overall planning structure is to first have digital mock-up prepared 
		by 03/24.  Next we will aggregate and input all necessary textual content 
		and to complete basic HTML, css, and JavaScript coding/debugging by April 
		10. After we will work on intensive design and more advanced 
		JavaScript/jQuery/animations until April 29. Images and GIFs needed for 
		design will be worked on throughout both periods.  Any additional backend 
		features will be documented, but not prioritized, unless all other required 
		functionalities are tested and working by the project deadline. More specific 
		deadlines are covered in the section on Organizational Structure.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The files will be organized using the following folder structure and file 
		names. </p>
		
		<p>
		<strong>home.shtml</strong> - The home page will include a photo-splash slideshow 
		of recent events (event1.jpg, event2.jpg, etc) and the flier for the upcoming open 
		mic event (openmic_date.jpg). This means that the slideshow photos will 
		have to be updated at the beginning of every month. <br>
		<strong>about.shtml</strong> - The About page will include a collection of GIFs, which we 
		will create using our own illustrations (arts.gif, technology.gif, 
		community.gif from the /about folder) that defines the three characteristics 
		the EMW space: Art, Technology, and Community. There will also be brief 
		descriptions for history, mission, and goals. <br>
		<strong>people.shtml</strong> - This page will have headshot images of each member in EMW 
		(from the /people/members folder). These headshots and textual information 
		about the members (name, who they are, their specific involvement in EMW) 
		will be provided by the client. <br>
		<strong>orgs.shtml</strong> - This page is a portal for EMW’s partner organizations. 
		Currently, they are: BPAC, ModKit, Little Devices, Subdrift. Their organizations will 
		be represented on the page in a grid format with their logos (under the 
		/orgs folder). Once the user selects the logo, they can see all the 
		information about the organization and how they’ve collaborated with EMW 
		and for more information, they can be directed to the organizations’ personal 
		web pages. <br>
		<strong>events.shtml</strong> - A more readable and comprehensive page of upcoming events 
		and programs for the user to scroll through. The information includes 
		very basic information such as: event title, date, and location.  It will 
		also have a fixed section on the main recurring programs at EMW, describing 
		what the program is, its purpose in the space, and the organizations that 
		run the program. <br>
		<strong>event_info.shtml</strong> - The page will have more detailed information on each 
		specific event.  There will be many event_info.shtml pages, one for each 
		new event. <br>
		<strong>archive.shtml</strong> - This is a page that is a collection of all past events and 
		programs in a condensed grid format, using the event images as thumbnails. 
		Clicking on the thumbnail will take you to the selected event page. These 
		will be sorted by date from most recent on top. <br>
		<strong>contact.shtml</strong> - The contact page contains a contact form, which provides 
		options for space requests, or sending any questions or concerns. It also 
		has a form for signing up to be a part of the EMW mailing list. 

		</p>



		<h2>Navigation Structure</h2>

		<p>The navigation structure is a combination of a clique and a network. 
		The main pages are all connected with each other via a navigation bar but 
		there exist specific subpages that can only be accessed through a limited number 
		of routes.
		The webpage will have a fixed navigation bar at the top of the page, visible and 
		accessible from all subpages. Every main page: home, about, people, orgs, events and 
		contact will be linked to each other.  Past events and specific information on events 
		will be subpages only accessible either directly from upcoming events on the homepage 
		or through links located on the events page and archive of all upcoming and past 
		events. The archive page will only be accessible via the events page.

		<h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>
		<p>
		This website will contain animations, a contact form validation, calendar and 
		date manipulations, rollovers, and slideshows. The animations will be used 
		on the About page to dynamically illustrate what EMW is about and the 
		elements that make it into an organization. Specific images will be 
		manipulations of the logo (arts.gif, technology.gif, community.gif). 
		(Stephanie and Annie will work jointly on concept design and split up the 
		execution evenly).
		The contact form available on the contact page will use JavaScript to 
		validate the entered email address and check to see if any fields are empty 
		(Annie). 
		The Date object will be used to timestamp every event that is posted on the 
		website for use when the events are placed into the archive. This will 
		allow for easier and more accessible browsing of past events (Stephanie).
		We will use JavaScript to make the links in the navigation bar change states 
		when the mouse hovers over the link area (Annie).
		We will use jQuery’s animate method and JavaScript to create expanding boxes 
		that will animate with a mouse action for more information on community 
		members and organizations (Stephanie).
		Lastly, we will use jQuery and JavaScript to create a slideshow of images 
		of upcoming events on the main homepage (Stephanie and Annie). 
		Additional open source JavaScripts that we may utilize will be for scrolling 
		and transitioning effects. 
		</p>

		<h2>Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
		<p>This website will be designed to be dynamic and eye-catching and 
		therefore, will have less structural consistency throughout all the pages 
		and more focus on a design appropriate layout for the content.  We plan on 
		using design elements based on the client’s new EMW logo and color scheme. 
		Every page will share this common color scheme along with a fixed 
		navigation bar positioned at the top center.  The EMW logo will appear on 
		the top left corner above the navigation bar. There will be icons to 
		direct people to social media pages and a form for signing up for the 
		Mailing List at the bottom of each page.
		The Home page will be the most visual-heavy, simple page with an image 
		slideshow taking up 80% of the page real estate. All other pages will 
		utilize a dynamic “hide and reveal” of information type theme along with 
		standard vertical scrolling. 
		The website will be left aligned and follow the liquid layout.
		The main text will be dark grey at 12pt, Avenir-regular. All other text will 
		be stylized as appropriate (navigation bar will be Avenir-medium). We will 
		embed this downloaded font into the CSS file. The alternative is font-
		family: sans-serif. 
		Accent colors will be: #FFC000, #35COCD, #EC0033
